INTRODUCTION

DimScape is a zzstructure browser and editor written in C++ with Qt. It can be used as a mind mapper, an organizer, or even possibly a spreadsheet.

WHAT IS A ZZSTRUCTURE?

A zzstructure is a particular type of data structure invented by Project Xanadu, and it consists of a group of cells, each of which have a link to at most two neighbouring cells in each of n dimensions. One of these cells will be connected forward (or posward) and the other one will be connected backward (negward). By viewing only two dimensions at a time and cunningly changing which dimensions are viewed, one can very easily navigate such a structure, which makes it in some ways more useful than typical mind mapping software.

WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT DIMSCAPE?

There are (or were) several other zzstructure navigator projects in the works. DimScape is different in several important ways:
 * Unlike gzz, we plan to implement complete support for creating and editing zzstructures by the first release
 * This software is not limited to displaying text in its cells
 * DimScape uses a sqlite database as its backend, giving it a much higher upper limit to the number of cells
 * The use of modal editing and the z2 display mode are unique to DimScape
 * We have a better logo

WHAT ARE THE FUTURE PLANS?

Once we have all of the core functionality up, running, and stable, we plan to implement a forth-like language that can take advantage of the unique attributes of zzstructure-based programming. We also plan to make use of a naming hierarchy in dimensions, create a plugin system for supporting new cell types, and create built-in support for displaying videos and mixed-type cell contents loaded from the user's filesystem.
